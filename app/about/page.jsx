      <h4 className='mt-5 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl w-full max-w-full'>BestPromps empowers you to interact with various types of AI tools by providing prompts that unlock their potential. Here's how you can make the most of different AI tools using the prompts you find:</h4>
      <ul className='w-full max-w-full mt-4 pl-4 space-y-1 list-disc list-inside font-semibold'>
        <li>Language Generation AIs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models)</li>
        <p className='font-normal pl-8'>Language Generation AI models are like smart computer programs that can write and talk just like people do. Using prompts with these models is like giving them a hint or telling them what you want them to write about.</p>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence Image Generator (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney)</li>
        <p className='font-normal pl-8'>Using prompts with an AI image generator is a bit like describing a picture you want. You type in words that tell the AI what you're thinking about, then, the AI takes those words and uses them to create a picture that matches what you said.</p>
        <li>Coding Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot)</li>
        <p className='font-normal pl-8'>Give coding prompts to AI assistants and enhance your programming journey. These tools offer code suggestions, autocompletions, and smart recommendations, streamlining your coding process.</p>
      </ul>

      <h4 className='mt-5 text-lg text-gray-600 sm:text-xl w-full max-w-full'>BestPromps isn't solely about prompts, it's about the knowledge people share, the code they crack, and the solutions they create. Dive into a community of forward-thinkers, a place where prompt-sharing becomes an art form.</h4>
